Django-Frontend-Notification
============================

Django application to quickly display on the frontend the list of notifications and run some basic actions such as "view all notifications", "delete notifications", etc... Django-Frontend-Notification also provides some helpers to display new notifications.

This works with twitter bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) but can easily be adapted with other front-end framework.
